    LAZY STATE INITIALIZATION: If we don't put it in a function everytime the app renders it will execute that line of code, if it's a console log for example it doesn't matter because it's not a heavy task for the browser but if it's like in this case retrieving information from the application and data storage it is better to put it in a function so it only renders the first time, if not the app will run slower.
