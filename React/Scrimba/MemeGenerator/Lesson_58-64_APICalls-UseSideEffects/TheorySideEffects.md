What are React's primary tasks?
- Work with the DOM / browser to render UI to the page
- Manage state for us between render cycles (i.e. state values are "remembered" from one render to the next)
- Keep the UI updated whenever state changes occur.

What can't React handle on its own?
- (Out)side effects!
    - localStorage
    - API/database interactions
    - Subscriptions (e.g. web sockets)
    - Syncing 2 different internal states together
    - Basically anything that React isn't in charge of
